<h3>My name is Honeybun. I live with my family and my sister named Make (pronounced Maki).
I am 50 percent Chihuahua and 50 percent mixed breed. I am so long. I can even be longer than Make!
I often get bad gas, I also growl and bark a lot.</h3>

<h3>I need</h3> 
<ul>
  <li>new toys</li>
  <li>new beds</li>
  <li>cute clothes</li>
</ul> 
<h3>One day me and my family were walking by the construction site and some construction workers threw a gaint burrito
and a huge New york pizza slice over the fence me and maki ran over and started horfing down the food.
I tried to swallow it hole but it just stuck out the side of my mouth. maki started eating the pizza.
Whenever we go there me and maki get exited.</h3>

<h3>one day we drove and drove. we ended up at the river it was a cold day.
Around the end of the trip my family went in the water. the kept calling me in but I just whined on shore.
first I pawed the water then my head fell into the water. I swam in a semi circle then hoped beack on shore.
The whole family was watching me and luaghing.</h3>
